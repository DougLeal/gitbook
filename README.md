Rhiot is a messaging platform for the Internet Of Things. We are focused on an adoption of the
[Red Hat JBoss middleware portfolio](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware) to provide solutions to
the common IoT-related challenges.

IoT is a cross-domain discipline, so the scope of the topics covered by Rhiot is also significant. Feel free to jump
to an arbitrary section of this documentation depending on what you are interested in - 
[production-grade field gateway](gateway/index.md), [mini field gateway](gateway/mini/index.md), 
[backend data streams](backend/index.md) or our [tooling](tooling/index.md) (
including [command line tool](tooling/cmd.md), [interactive shell](tooling/shell.md) and 
[IoT performance meter](https://rhiot.gitbooks.io/rhiotdocumentation/content/performance/index.html)).

Or may we are just interested in [blueprint projects](quickstarts/index.md) which can be used to quickly start working with
IoT solutions.
