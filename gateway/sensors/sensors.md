# Gateway sensors

Gateway sensors are plugins that can be added to the classpath of `CloudPlatform` running on a gateway device in order
to enable synchronization of data from certain sensor to the IoT Connector. For example you can add camera sensor jar
to your classpath in order to enable streaming of camera data to the IoT Connector.
