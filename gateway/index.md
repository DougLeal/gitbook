# Gateway

IoT field gateway is a small computer deployed into a field and acting as a proxy between sensors and a data center.

Rhiot gateway support is primarily focused on providing some additional utilities to make working with 
[Eclipse Kura](https://www.eclipse.org/kura) based gateways easier.

*Rhiot mini gateway* is a small fat jar application wrapping a subset of Kura functionalities. Its primary
target is to provide a rapid gateway software for makers and developers community.
